Example project for the NodeJs framework
--
The application is just a user login management form
No database are used, the data is saved within the aplication
and is erased if the application is stopped.
--
I've mostly used the Jade view engine but there is an example with the 
html view engine and jquery template.
For that, you just have to comments the lines 47, and 68 and ucomment
lines 52 and 70 in the app.js file
