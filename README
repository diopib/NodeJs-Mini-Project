Example project for the NodeJs framework
--
The application is just a user login management form
No database are used, the data is saved within the aplication
and is erased if the application is stopped.
--
I've mostly used the Jade view engine but there is an example with the 
html view engine and jquery template.
For that, you just have to comments the lines 43, and 61 and comment
lines 38 and 59
